# Sonic Annotator's summary method integrates the values across
# time. If an output lacks duration for its features, each feature is
# considered to extend until the timestamp of the following feature,
# and the final feature is considered to extend until the end of the
# input or the last-ending output, whichever is later.
#
# The curve-vsr output is therefore considered to have 9 values (0.0
# to 0.8) that span 0.75 seconds each, followed by one value (0.9)
# that spans the 3 seconds from 6.75 to 9.75 where the final output of
# the plugin ends (that's the notes-regions output).
#
# Since the values from this output are already sorted and are
# distinct, the integrated median is just whatever is in effect at
# time 9.75 / 2.0 = 4.875. This value is 0.6.
