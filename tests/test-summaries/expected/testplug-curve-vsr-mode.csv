# Sonic Annotator's summary method integrates the values across
# time. If an output lacks duration for its features, each feature is
# considered to extend until the timestamp of the following feature,
# and the final feature is considered to extend until the end of the
# input or the last-ending output, whichever is later.
#
# The curve-vsr output is therefore considered to have 9 values (0.0
# to 0.8) that span 0.75 seconds each, followed by one value (0.9)
# that spans the 3 seconds from 6.75 to 9.75 where the final output of
# the plugin ends (that's the notes-regions output).
#
# The modal value is the one spanning the longest, which of course is
# that final one, 0.9.
