# Sonic Annotator's summary method integrates the values across
# time. If an output lacks duration for its features, each feature is
# considered to extend until the timestamp of the following feature,
# and the final feature is considered to extend until the end of the
# input or the last-ending output, whichever is later.
#
# The curve-vsr output is therefore considered to have 9 values (0.0
# to 0.8) that span 0.75 seconds each, followed by one value (0.9)
# that spans the 3 seconds from 6.75 to 9.75 where the final output of
# the plugin ends (that's the notes-regions output).
#
# The sum of 0.0..0.8 is 3.6, so the mean is (3.6 * 0.75 + 0.9 * 3.0)
# / 9.75 = 0.553846 approx.
# 
# Equivalently we can consider the last feature the same as four
# features of 0.75 seconds each (i.e. the same durations as the first
# 9) each with the same value, 0.9. The mean is then the sum of
# 0.0..0.9 plus three more 0.9s, i.e. 7.2, divided by 13.
